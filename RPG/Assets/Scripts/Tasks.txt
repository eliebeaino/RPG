Changes to make:
- Change weapon scriptable to ressource folder system
- Changed movement speed from mover to base stats - use IModifier to grab it
- Add Min/Max damage to weapons and adjust calculations accordingly (enemy, weapon, projectile, etc...)
- make spreadsheet importer for progression

Known Bugs:
- fix rounding bug displaying 0 hp for enemies
- pick up item without going up close - applies to all interactables
- after picking up item, moves to the point where they were - due to movement being getmousebutton - not getmosuebuttondown - must find workaround
- ally aggro and self aggro need fixing, unintended behaviors
